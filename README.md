Main Objective:
Make an Application available to farmers that can help them transition to greenhouse framing.


Main Research questions:
1. Make an Application available to farmers that can help them transition to greenhouse framing.
2. Help farmers to transition to greenhouse framing. 
3. Reduce the impact of initial capital loss through planning. 
4. Help farmers by managing the green house. 
5. This should help the farmers keep the prices of crops at a stable point though mitigation of over and under supply.

Individual research questions:
1. apply a machine learning model to produce a new optimum technique for selecting the best crop for green house vertical farming systems.
2. Improve land planning for greenhouse plantations through the use of augmented reality. 
3. Develop a secure climatic condition automation system while understanding the issues and constraints faced by domestic, small scale greenhouse farmers. 
4. Image processing is used for the detection of plant diseases by capturing the images of the leaves and comparing it with the data sets. 

Individual Objectives:
1. The application should help the farmers keep the prices of crops at a stable point though mitigation of over and under supply.
2. Help farmers reduce the impact of initial capital loss through structure and land planning. 
3. Help farmers by managing environment conditions in the greenhouse to maximize profits.
4. Help maintain profits by detecting deceases early.
